**Paginize** is a library for easily applying pagination to the existing DOM, implemented in **TypeScrip**t. Furthermore, it can reliably create pagination UI that complies with [WAI-ARIA guidelines](https://design-system.w3.org/components/pagination.html "タイトル")  with minimal configuration. <br>
You can also get this with just a little CSS writing: note: you will need to write your own CSS to get this UI. This package does not provide CSS.
